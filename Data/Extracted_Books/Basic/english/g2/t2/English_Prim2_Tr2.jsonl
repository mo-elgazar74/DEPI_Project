{"text": "Language: xxxxxxxxxx\nForeword\nThe MOETE launched Egypts reform vision for the development of education, and the process of developing curricula\ncomes at the heart of this vision. The implementation of this vision was heralded in 2018, starting with the kindergarten stage in its first and second grades, with the aim of continuing until the end of the secondary stage.\nThis vision endeavored to make major transformations in the teaching and learning processes, where there is a transition\nfrom acquiring knowledge to producing it, and from learning skills to employing them both in specific learning situations and in the general life of the learner outside the classroom. Our curricula also integrate values that contribute to the establishment of our societyvalues which pose as a protective fort for our homeland. Egypts reform vision for curriculum development also aims to take into account the specifications of pre-university education graduates, as well as the challenges Egypt faces locally, regionally, and globally. The developed curricula are intended to foster a citizen who is capable of engaging in civilized conversations and positive dialogues with the other, in addition to acquiring digital citizenship skills.\nIn this regard, the MOETE extends its gratitude and appreciation to the Central Administration of Curriculum\nDevelopment. It also extends its thanks and gratitude to Longman Egypt and York Press for their active participation in the preparation of this book. Gratefulness also goes to all the Ministrys experts who contributed to the enrichment of this work.\nThis transformation of Egypts educational system would not have been possible without the significant support of\nEgypts current president, His Excellency President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Overhauling the educational system is part of the Presidents vision of rebuilding the Egyptian citizen and it is closely coordinated with the Ministries of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Culture, and Youth and Sports. The new educational system is only a part in a bigger national effort to propel Egypt to the ranks of developed countries, and to ensure a great future for all of its citizens.\nReviewed byThe General Administration for Planning and Formulating Curriculum\nWords from the Minister of Education and Technical Education\nDear students and fellow teachers,\nIt gives me great pleasure to celebrate this crucial stage of comprehensive and sustainable development, an epic in which\nall Egyptian people are taking part. This pivotal stage necessitates paving a foundation for a strong educational system which yields a generation that is not only capable of facing the major challenges the world is witnessing today, but one that also has complete possession of the skills of the future. For this reason, the Egyptian state is keen on empowering its citizens by establishing a top-notch educational system that invests in its children the expertise required to get them to compete at both a regional and global level, at a time when the world is witnessing successive industrial revolutions.\nThis dictates that our educational system has at its core an emphasis on skills development, deep understanding, and\nknowledge production. This can only be done through modern curricula that keep up with the changes taking place globally-- curricula which prioritize the development of skills and values, and the integration of knowledge. They are also curricula that focus on the provision of multiple learning sources, and integration of technology to enrich the educational process and to improve its outcomes, while addressing the most important contemporary issues.\nTo achieve this, we must all join hands to continue to revolutionize our education, and to support it with all that is\nrequired to transform it into a globally pioneering educational system.\nMy warmest regards to you, dear students, and my deepest gratitude to my fellow teachers.\nProfessor Doctor Reda Hegazy\nMinister of Education and Technical Education", "metadata": {"page": 2, "subject": "english", "grade": "g2", "term": "t2", "source": "English_Prim2_Tr2.pdf"}}

My Day at School
Hi Mark,
How are you? I hope you’re doing well. I want to tell you about a typical day at my
school here in Egypt.
My day starts early. I wake up around 6:30 a.m., get dressed, and have a quick
breakfast—usually bread, cheese, and fruit.
The School day begins at 7:30. We start it by standing in line, saluting the flag, and
singing the national anthem. Then we go to our classrooms and begin our lessons.
Our first subject is usually Arabic.
Next, we have subjects like math, English, and science. Some topics are a bit tricky,
but I try my best. At around 10:15, we have a short break. I usually eat a sandwich,
play with my friends, chat and laugh.
Later, we have more lessons like social studies, religion, or computer. I enjoy
learning how to use the computer in class. However, my favorite subject is P.E.
The school day ends at 1:30 p.m. I usually feel a bit tired, but I’m happy after a good
day. I go home, eat lunch, rest a little, and then do my homework.
That’s what a school day looks like for me. What about you?
Bye for now,
Fady

Hi John,
How are you? I want to tell you about the
weather in Egypt today. It is very different
from one place to another.
In Alexandria, it’s windy and rainy. The sky is
full of dark clouds and the waves are high.
People are staying indoors because it’s cold and the streets are wet.
Some shops are closing early.
In Cairo, the weather is warm and sunny. People are walking in the streets.
Children are playing in the parks. Some students are doing their homework
outdoors. I can see birds flying in the clear sky.
In Aswan, it is hot. The sun is very strong, and the sky is clear. Farmers
water their plants early in the morning. People drink lots of water, wear
hats and sunglasses, and sit in the shade to protect themselves from the
sun.
Now, Egyptians are checking the weather to help people take care of their
homes and plants.
What is the weather like in your city? Write back soon.

The Wonderful Nile River
The Wonderful Nile River
The Nile is the longest river in the world. It is about 6,650 kilometers long. The Nile
flows through Egypt from south to north. It goes through the desert and brings
life to the country.
Many animals live in and near the Nile. Big fish like Nile perch and tilapia swim in
the water. Crocodiles live in the river too. They are dangerous animals. Many birds
come to the river to drink and find food. You can see kingfishers, herons, and
ducks near the Nile.
The Nile is very important for
Egyptian people. In the past, the
river flooded and brought good soil.
Farmers used this soil to grow food
like wheat and vegetables. The Nile
provides people and animals with
water to drink. People also use the
river to travel in boats.
The Ancient Egyptians thought the
Nile was special. They built temples
near the river. Today, many people
still depend on the Nile for their jobs and food.

Unforgettable Trip to
Unforgettable Trip to
Wadi El Rayan
Wadi El Rayan
Last Thursday, our school organized a trip to Wadi El Rayan
National Park in Fayoum. Our class teacher, Miss Salma, and
science teacher, Mr. Ahmed, came with us. We left school
early and rode the bus for two hours.
On the way, we saw green farms, sand dunes, and camels
walking in the distance. When we arrived, a kind guide named
Mr. Tarek showed us the lakes, the waterfalls, and the palm
trees. He explained that Wadi El Rayan is not only beautiful,
but it also protects rare animals and plants.
After lunch, we took another short trip into the desert—to
a place called Wadi El-Hitan, or Valley of the Whales. This
place was covered by sea. Scientists found the skeletons of
ancient whales there. We saw real whale bones in the sand
and even a fossil museum!
I wanted to take a picture of the skeletons with my camera
when I realized that it wasn’t with me. I looked everywhere
with no luck. Thankfully, Mr. Ahmed found it tucked under a
wooden bench outside the exhibit just before we left that
area.
That trip was full of nature, history, and fun with friends.

The Proud Rose
The Proud Rose
Once upon a time, in a dry desert far
away, there lived a beautiful rose.
She had soft red petals that sparkled
in the sunlight and gave off a sweet,
lovely smell. Every creature in the
desert admired her beauty, and the
rose knew it. She was very proud of
how she looked and believed she was
the most special plant in the desert.
Growing next to the rose was an old,
rough cactus. He was covered in
long, sharp thorns and didn’t have
any flowers or bright colors. The
rose didn’t like the cactus at all. She
looked at him every day and thought
he was unpleasant to look at. “Why
do you have so many thorns?” she
would ask. “You’re so rough and
unpleasant to look at.” Even though
the cactus never said anything mean
back, the rose kept making fun of
him.
Seasons passed, and one year, the
summer was much hotter than usual.
The sun shone, and the desert grew
even drier. All the small plants began
to dry up. Soon, the beautiful rose
started to lose her color. Her petals
became dry and weak. She was
very thirsty, but there was no water
anywhere. One day, the rose saw a
small bird fly down and gently peck
at the cactus. The bird drank some
water from inside the cactus and
flew away, happy and refreshed.
The rose was surprised. She didn’t
know the cactus had water inside.
Feeling embarrassed, the rose
spoke to the cactus. “I’m sorry for
the way I treated you,” she said. “I
didn’t know you were so strong and
helpful. Could you please give me
some water?” The kind cactus smiled
and shared his water with the rose.
Slowly, the rose came back to life.
From that day on, she never judged
anyone by how they looked again.

Before you read, answer the following question
Why is it important to save energy at home, school, and in

Read the text. What are some ways we can save electricity at home?
Lesson 2
Let’s Use Energy
Wisely!
Energy is something we all need every day—to light our homes, cook, watch TV,
and charge our phones. In Egypt, we use electricity,
gas, and solar power. But energy is not endless, so
we must use it wisely. Some energy comes from
nature, like solar and wind, which are clean and
don’t pollute. Egypt has lots of sunshine, so using
more solar panels saves money and helps the
planet.
Other energy types, like oil and gas, can harm the
Earth. We should save energy by turning off lights and devices when not in use,
closing the fridge door quickly, and using the right size pot for cooking. Cars
and buses use fuel which pollutes the air. Walking or biking short distances also
saves energy and keeps us healthy.
Wasting energy causes climate change, which affects animals and their homes.
Small daily actions can make a big difference. Together, we can protect our
country and planet—we should all be Energy Heroes!

Lesson3
Gifts from Under
the Ground
Egypt has many valuable things under the ground. We call these things
minerals. They are very important for our country.
Egypt has a lot of oil, rocks, and metals. We find oil deep under the ground,
especially in the Western Desert and Sinai. Oil is a black liquid. Egypt sells oil
to other countries. This brings money to Egypt. Egypt also has a lot of natural
gas that we can use for cooking, heating, and making electricity for lights and
TVs.
Gold is a beautiful, yellow, shiny metal. Long ago, Ancient Egyptians used gold
to make beautiful jewelry for kings and queens. Today, Egypt still finds gold in
the Eastern Desert. Also, Egypt has iron in the Eastern Desert. Iron is a strong
metal. We use iron to make steel.
We use it to build big buildings and
cars.
The soil in Egypt contains different
kinds of minerals which help plants
grow big and strong.
These natural resources help
Egypt grow and develop. By using
these minerals wisely, Egypt can
build a strong future for everyone.
Look and read.

Lesson4
Man-Made Resources
Hi! I’m Omar, and I’m doing a research project about man-
made resources for my English class. I started by reading a
book and searching the internet with my dad. I wrote facts
in my notebook and printed pictures to help explain.
Man-made resources are things people create using
natural materials. For example, plastic is made from oil and
used for bottles, toys, and school supplies. Glass is made from sand
and used in windows, mirrors, and cups. One interesting resource I learned
about is bricks, made by mixing clay and water, then dried or baked. They
are used to build houses, schools, and walls.
Paper is made from trees and processed in factories for writing and
reading. People also recycle paper to make notebooks and newspapers.
To complete my project, I drew pictures of each resource and shared
helpful tips, such as recycling plastic, reusing paper, and using cloth bags
instead of plastic ones. Doing research was an important
part of my work because it helped me understand
new ideas, find accurate information, and learn more
about the world around me.

Lesson 4
The High Dam
Egyptians built the High
Dam in Aswan between
1960 and 1970. It was
officially completed
and opened in 1970.  It
took around ten years
to build. Now, it helps
Egypt with water and
electricity every day.
When did Egyptians
build it?
The High Dam helps people in many ways. Farmers use the water for
irrigation, to grow vegetables, fruits, and grains all year. The dam also
sends electricity to houses, schools, hospitals, and factories across
Egypt. It protects cities from dangerous floods, and it makes sure people
have water even when the river is low.
"How does The High Dam help people?"
The High Dam is a huge wall
that crosses the Nile River
in Aswan, Egypt. It holds
a large lake called Lake
Nasser. The dam stops the
river from flooding and
keeps water for people to
use during the year.
What is the High Dam?
They built the High Dam
to solve problems with
flooding and drought.
They also wanted to give
people clean electricity
and help farmers grow
more crops with regular
water.
Why did Egyptians
build it?

that offers great views from the mountain to the sea. Al Galala is also
a center for education and science. Galala University welcomes students
from Egypt and abroad to study medicine, engineering, and more.
In the past, the area was empty, but now it is full of life. People work in
hotels, teach, or run businesses. More families are moving in to enjoy its

Past Simple
- We use the past simple for:
a. actions that started and finished in the past.
Example: She baked a delicious cake yesterday.
b. actions that happened one after another in the past.
Example: We entered the museum, took photos, and bought souvenirs.
c. habits in the past.
Example: They played outside after school every day.
Affirmative
Negative
Use (subject) + (past form of
the verb).
Examples: He visited his uncle
last Friday.
Use (subject) + did not (didn’t)
+    infinitive form of the verb.
Example: Noha didn’t clean the
house last night.
For regular verbs, add -ed, -d, or -ied to the main verb.
Examples: play → played                   smile → smiled                    cry → cried
Irregular verbs have special past forms. They change in different ways.
Examples: go → went                         eat → ate                         buy → bought
The past forms of verb to be are was/were in the affirmative form or
wasn’t/weren’t in the negative form.
Examples: In the past, Al Galala Plateau was empty. There were no
homes or roads.
We use was/were in the question. We don’t use “did” with verb to be.
Example: Was Maher at home yesterday?  - No, he wasn’t. He was outside.

Egypt Goes Green
Egypt Goes Green
Do you agree or disagree?
We can get energy from the sun.
2 Clean energy destroys the planet.
3 People in villages can’t work with modern technology.
Read Mariam’s article. What’s her opinion about Benban?
Agree
Disagree
Egypt is a sunny country, making it
ideal for solar energy. One important
project is Benban Solar Park near
Aswan, one of the world’s largest
solar stations. Built between 2018
and 2019, it has over 6 million panels
and provides electricity to homes,
schools, hospitals, and factories.
Benban uses clean, sustainable
energy, reducing pollution and keeping
the air safe. It also creates thousands
of jobs for engineers, builders, and
people from nearby villages, helping
them support their families.
The project is important because it
saves money by using sunlight instead
of expensive fuel, protects the
environment, and brings jobs to Upper
Egypt. Although some workers need
training, it helps them learn new skills
and improves local communities.
Benban Solar Park is a smart and
valuable project for Egypt. It benefits
people, protects nature, and supports
development. It’s a proud step toward
a cleaner, better future.

Unit 6
In a bright and busy school, three friends—Noor, Ahmed, and Farida—were always
looking for ways to help. One sunny morning, they noticed something that made
them stop. A tap in the school bathroom kept dripping, even when no one used
it. In the garden, water overflowed from a broken pipe and formed little puddles
near the walkway.
“We waste too much water,” Noor said, shaking her head. She watched the drops
fall one after another, knowing they were too precious to waste.
Ahmed said. “We need to take better care of our resources,” he agreed. We can’t
afford to be careless.”
Farida, always full of ideas, snapped her fingers. “Let’s do something about it! We
can be Water Savers! We can show everyone that small actions matter.”
They went to their teacher’s office and explained their plan. “We want to do
a project to help our school use water wisely,” Noor explained. Their teacher smiled
brightly. “That’s a wonderful idea. Go for it—and let me know how I can help.”
--- Page 89 ---
The next day, the three friends got to work. They started by walking around the
school with a notebook, a camera, and curious eyes. Noor wrote down everything
she noticed: leaky taps, students leaving water running while washing their
hands, and hoses left on too long in the garden.
Ahmed used his tablet to take photos of the problems so they could show them
later in their presentations. Farida, the artist, brought out her colored markers
and made bright, cheerful posters. One read:
“Turn off the tap while brushing!”
Another said: “Every drop counts. Fix leaks fast!”
They also spoke to
the school cleaner,
Mr. Youssef, who was
surprised but pleased to
see the students taking
action. “I’d love your help,”
he said as they watched
him fix a leaking sink. He
explained how
a small drip could waste
liters of water each day.
The kids listened carefully and learned a lot. But not everyone understood their
role. One afternoon, a classmate said to them unkindly near the hallway. “Why do
you care about water so much? It’s just a few drops.”
Noor looked him in the eye. “Because water is life,” she said firmly. “We all need it,
and we all need to protect it.”
Her friends stood beside her, proud and quiet. They didn’t let the bullying stop
them. They believed in what they were doing.
--- Page 90 ---
Unit 6
Soon, their message began to spread. The school hung their posters in
bathrooms, classrooms, and near garden taps. Teachers took a few minutes each
day to talk about how to save water. Some classes even had mini-challenges to
see who could save the most!
One morning, the head teacher gave the children, Noor, Ahmed, and Farida
certificates of achievement for their hard work. From that day on, everyone at the
school became a Water Saver.

A Day in Egypt
It is a great day in Cairo. Maged visits Khan El Khalili with his family. It is very
exciting!
In the old streets, they can do many activities.
First, they buy souvenirs from the market. There are many beautiful things like
bags, lamps, and bracelets. His sister chooses a colorful necklace.
Then, they walk through the old streets and watch people baking bread. The
smell is amazing! They also see shops where workers make furniture by hand. It is
interesting to watch them work.
They take more photos in the old streets. There are many beautiful doors and
buildings with Arabic designs. Maged stands near a big wooden gate and smiles
for the camera. Then, they walk to a small museum. It has old coins, clothes, and
tools from the past. They learn many new things about Egyptian history.
They also see some children playing with small drums in the street. They laugh
and enjoy the music. Maged's brother joins them for a few minutes. It is fun to
play and enjoy the sounds of Old Cairo.
In the evening, they visit ancient sites near the area. They are big and beautiful!
They take many photos of them.
It is a fun day. He loves spending time in Egypt and learning about its culture.

Hello! I’m Amina from Ezbet El Borg in Damietta. People here are
fishermen. I accompany my father to catch fish early in the morning.
Some villagers work in fish factories or repair boats. We eat fish
almost every day and enjoy the cool sea breeze.
Omar:
My name is Omar. I live in Shakhlouba in Kafr El Sheikh near Lake Manzala.
People fish using small wooden boats. I help my uncle clean the
fishing nets. Some women also help catch fish. In the evening, we sit
together and drink hot tea outside.

My family spins wool and weaves it on looms. I help my mother dye

Grandpa: Thank you, Laila. I take care of it every day. Plants need water, sunlight,

Laila:
What kinds of plants do you have here?
Grandpa: I grow herbs like basil, mint, and parsley. We use them in many Egyptian
dishes. Some add flavor, and others are good for health.
Laila:
Oh, Dad drinks mint tea every evening on the balcony. It helps him
relax.
Grandpa: Yes, it tastes good. I also grow hibiscus and jasmine. They smell lovely,
and we use hibiscus to make a tasty drink.
Laila:
Mom makes hibiscus tea all the time! And jasmine smells amazing at
night.
Grandpa:  I have guava and fig trees, too. Their fruit is sweet and healthy. Over
there are the olive trees.
Laila:
Wow! Do Egyptians really grow olives?
Grandpa: Yes. Olives take time to grow, but they are full of oil. People grew olive
trees in Egypt many years ago—and they still do.
Laila:
That’s cool! How do you care for all these plants?

Yes, we can. I’m sure our classmates will be able to help too.
Mariam:  But there’s another problem — traffic near the school.
Hadi:
It’s very noisy and dangerous.
Nour:
We can’t cross the road safely in the morning.
Mariam:  Maybe we can ask our principal to help.
Hadi:
Can she talk to someone about it?

Yes! She may be able to speak with the traffic officer.
Nour:
I think we should make signs that say “Drive Slowly!”

Yes, we can, and we should also walk or ride bikes when we can.

Unit 4: Lesson 1 Exercise 2 (P.56)
Nour:  Hey Omar! Are you working on the history project?
Omar:  Yes! I’m reading about materials the ancient Egyptians used. It’s so cool.
They used stone, clay, papyrus, linen, wood, and even gold!
Nour:  That’s amazing! I saw a picture of a papyrus scroll in a museum. It’s
unbelievable how long that material could survive.
Omar:  I know! And some materials are still used today. Stone is used in modern
buildings—just like they used it for pyramids and temples.
--- Page 105 ---
105
Nour:  And statues! I love how they carved huge statues from granite. We still
use stone today for sculptures and buildings.
Omar:  And linen! It’s made from flax. Ancient Egyptians wore it every day—and
even wrapped mummies in it.
Nour:  My grandma has a linen dress. It’s soft, cool, and simple.
Omar:  Clay is another interesting one. They made pots, jars, bricks—and small
statues and amulets too!
Nour:  Amulets? You mean, like small objects people believed could protect
them?
Omar:  Exactly! Some were shaped like animals. They used gold and small
colorful stones to make jewelry.
Nour:  These materials are natural, strong, and useful. That’s why they lasted
thousands of years. Ancient Egyptian culture is really fascinating.

temples, strong pharaohs, and amazing stories from history. Each year, tourists
from many countries come to explore the wonders of this unusual land. In Egypt,
history lives in every corner.
One of the newest and most exciting places to visit is the Grand Egyptian
Museum (GEM). Work on the museum took almost 20 years to finish. It stands near
the Pyramids in Giza, the museum was built in this spot so visitors can enjoy both
ancient and modern Egypt in one trip.
Visitors can see statues, golden jewelry, tools, real mummies, and even the
Solar Boat that belonged to King Khufu. The objects are shown in a special way
that tells the story of Egypt from the beginning to the end of the time of the
pharaohs.
At the entrance, there is an information desk where visitors can ask questions
or get help. The museum also uses modern technology, like smart screens and
amazing shows, to help people learn in a fun way.
The Grand Egyptian Museum is not just a building; It is a place where Egypt’s story

Unit 5 Lesson 3 Exercise 4 (P.73)
A long time ago, in a small village along the Nile River, there lived an old man with
his three sons. The old man was a farmer who worked hard growing crops on his
land. The farm was big and gave them plenty of food, but the three sons were
always fighting. They argued about who would water the crops, feed the animals,
and who worked the hardest.
This made their father very worried.
As the old man grew weaker, he became more worried about his sons. “My sons,”
he said, “you should stop fighting and work together. If you all unite, you will be
strong”. The three sons did not listen to their father.
One day, the father called his sons and showed them a bundle of sticks tied
together. He asked each son to break the bundle. Each one tried hard, but they
failed.
Then, the father untied the bundle and gave them single sticks. The sons broke
them easily.
“You see,” said the father, “these sticks are just like you. Together, you are strong.
But alone, you can be broken easily.” The father went on saying, “Unity gives
strength.” From that day on, the sons understood their father’s wisdom. They
stopped fighting and worked together.
